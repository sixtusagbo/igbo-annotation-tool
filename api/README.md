# Igbo Annotation API

This is the API for the Igbo Annotation project. It is a RESTful API that provides endpoints for the following:

- Named Entity Recognition

## Named Entity Recognition

The Named Entity Recognition endpoint is `/annotate/ner`. It accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing the text to be analyzed. The response is a JSON object containing the named entities found in the text. It can also be customized by providing a specific aggregation strategy.

We used [`mbeukman/xlm-roberta-base-finetuned-igbo-finetuned-ner-igbo`](https://huggingface.co/mbeukman/xlm-roberta-base-finetuned-igbo-finetuned-ner-igbo) model for this feature.

Example request to `/annotate/ner?strategy=simple`:

```json
{
  "text": "Chinua Achebe bá»¥ onye edemede Nigeria"
}
```

Example response:

```json
